# ProjectEuler solutions in an assortment of languages

All the ProjectEuler problems that I'll attempt will be put here. I'll try to make the solution as elegant as possible w.r.t. to the language being used.

I have a strong feeling that this is also going to be an exercise in variable naming, modelling abstractions properly, etc.
